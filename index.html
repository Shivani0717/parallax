        <p>Between the mid-sixth and mid-fourth centuries B.C., Buddhism was founded in northeastern India and soon spread throughout the Asian subcontinent, influencing cultural and spiritual practices, art, and architecture. Today, around half a billion people around the world practice Buddhism, which is built upon principles like the Four Noble Truths and pursuit of nirvana. While traditional Buddhist temples often reflect the architectural styles of the region, all are designed to facilitate quiet reflection and meditation. (Here are 38 beautiful holy sites around the world.)</p>

        <p>The once-royal capital of Bagan was originally home to an estimated 10,000 Buddhist structures. Today, dusty footpaths weave around more than 2,000 remaining temples and pagodas, from Dhammayangyi, Bagan’s largest, to Shwezigon, the first gold-plated temple in Myanmar.

        <p>A stone’s throw from the tallest waterfall in Japan, Seiganto-ji is a forest-fringed sanctuary for Tendai, a rationalist school of Buddhism that believes in an ever-changing existence. Seiganto-ji is also a stop on two different pilgrimage routes: the 33-temple Saigoku trail, and the ancient Kumano Kodō, one of only two UNESCO-designated pilgrimage trails in the world.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1997, northern Thailand’s all-white Wat Rong Khun temple was designed and funded entirely by Thai painter Chalermchai Kositpipat. Mirror mosaics cover the facades, and depictions of Spider Man, Michael Jackson, and Hello Kitty decorate the main temple’s colorful interior. Despite its contemporary flair, visitors are expected to dress and behave with traditional reverence.</p>

        <p>Paro Taktsang in Bhutan’s Paro Valley is a cliffside temple that can only be reached by a semi-steep hike past waterfalls, prayer wheels, and a Tibetan teahouse with a view. Padmasambhava, the guru responsible for bringing Buddhism to Bhutan, is said to have meditated for three years in the caves of Paro Taktsang after flying there on the back of a magical female tiger, hence the nickname “Tiger’s Nest.”</p>

Inside, a golden Amida Buddha rises more than nine feet tall. Peacocks, black swans, and turtles roam the temple grounds, and surrounding garden ponds swarm with large schools of koi, some nearly one hundred years old.</p>
